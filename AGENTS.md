## Notes
- Lessons learned for bring-up, flashing, logging, and debugging are tracked in `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`. Keep it updated as you make progress.
- Check `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` first when picking a display/driver strategy or debugging black-screen issues.
- Add a short entry to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` after each debugging session so handoff is painless.
